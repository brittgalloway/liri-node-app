LIRI is a CLI App that finds infomation on song titles via Spotify, an artist's concert via Seat Geek, and find information on a movie title via OMDB.
With this app you can searh your favorite song, find the artist name, then look for a concert date and location. Or you can learn the stats of your favorite (maybe least favorite?) movie.

## Submission Guide

Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.
In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the `README.md` file should meet the following criteria:

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning

5. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
6. State your role in the app development

Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
